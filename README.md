# Chat-Bot

**Summary: Chat-Box in Java utilizing socket connections**

This is a command line chat tool.

It utilizes ssh connection to remote machines. It then will set up a server and a client on each machine to allow for multiple connections to be made with each machine. To do this, requires mutlithreading since one single server can only listen to one client at a time. Using mulithreading allows for messages to come in at real time between any number of cients connected to one machine's server. 

Extensions: Combine my *Haskell Enryptor* personal tool to this and allow for user-to-user enryption with no storage of messages for security purposes.
